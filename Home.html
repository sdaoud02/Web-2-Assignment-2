        <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he program <strong>Pathways to Belonging</strong> is designed to create a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for chilren and youth who are 
         new to Calgary. With arising conflicts worldwide we especially focus and support those arriving from those countries, one of them being Sudan. These families face challenges like financial strain, language barriers,
          and cultural disconnection. Moreovers, many parents often support extended families back home while adjusting to there new life here in Canada, making their childrenâ€™s social and emotional integration even more important.</p>
