The assignment was done together via messages and on call
Sketches in small, medium and large devices- Were done together
Edits from assignment 1 on to assignment 2 was done by Loren

So this respiratory looks like I am the one who has done everything, but Loren has done her part. I just readded everything to this new respiratory.
Also, when checking our reports for our wesbite on Wave, there is some discrepancy, for instance on About and Contact page, it shows that an h3 can't be used without the correct
hierarchy. I've changed it to h1,h2 and even h3 but the same error shows. There are a few other instances where the HTML is correct (I hope), but the Wave website and our website in 
general just isn't showin it.
